TurtleTrafo New Work Facilitator
After finishing our program you are able to guide teams to become more self-sufficient, flexible and efficient. By doing this you will inherently create an atmosphere of well being and security.
Our program is like a journey. Our central principle is living and leading from the inside to the outside. You will start close to home with yourself. Getting to know the workings of your inside world. With these basics in your backpack the journey leads you through the jungle of human coworking and existing. This phase is giving you hands-on knowledge and experience in forming human groups that are (over time) able to naturally adapt to different settings. The building blocks are seemingly contradictory elements: structure and flexibility, security and freedom, individuals and community.


Our Facilitator program consists of:

Modul 1: Personal Coaching
-by getting to know yourself through different perspectives
-learning the language of your inside world
-create a mapping mechanism for yourself



Modul 2: Structure and Flexibility

Modul 3: Security and Freedom

Modul 4: Individuals and Community

Modul 5: Wrap up and Certification
