Executives are leaders within an organization and usually have to handle a
complex role. Every day an executive leader has to make difficult and a lot
of decisions. Peers, direct reports, internal coaches and HR business partners
are good sparing partners but often bounded to the same business, strategy or
vision. Supervision with an external coach gives the opportunity to assure
the quality of your role and being aware about your focus topics.

Our executive supervision includes topics as personal live, personal development,
C-level relationship, key employees, organizational structures, organizational
strategy & dynamics & decisions, transformation processes and culture changes.
