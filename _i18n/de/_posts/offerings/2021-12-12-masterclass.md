We all aim for joy in our work and life. Changes as a new delivery deadline, a
new strategy focus, a new manager, a new role, or a new born child in our private life may create
big challenges and limit the joy. Modern managers are expected to handle all
these topics without any influence to performance and to keep their teams happy
and productive.

We are offering a "Work Freedom Business Masterclass" which trains you as a manager
to deliver high quality results all the time without loosing your joy. The
masterclass starts with yourself to find your inner focus and to
give you clarity about your needs on life and work. It will train you to support
your employees to find their own balance between work and life, and how to design
an organization which keeps flexible to all changes from the outside and inside.
The training covers aspects of "New Work", "Work 2.0", "Mindfulness" and "Empathy".
It follows the vision that happy employees are the most engaged and committed
employees.

The masterclass is running for 12 months. There will be 3 weeks of off-site training,
a bi-weekly peer-group sharing session, a monthly coaching session and a "make the
next step" month with coaching for two times per week. You can book the masterclass
either as a private person or as a company you can book your private masterclass
for your managers.
