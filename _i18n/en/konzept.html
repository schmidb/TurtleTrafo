        We share our path with you and accompany you on your
        transformation as an individual, as a family or as a company. We strive for
        a togetherness between individuals, between family members and
        between work and private life. The focus here is on a life that is itself
        feels fulfilling and worth living in every moment.</p>

        <p>In all of our transformations - including our own - we follow our "Inside Out" process.
        <ol style = "text-align: left">
          <li> I look inside </li>
          <li> I look outside </li>
          <li> I reflect and change </li>
          <li> I feel and go back to step 1 </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this process, each individual can take responsibility for himself and
          at eye level in the contact or authentic exchange with oneself, one
          family member, work colleague, or other individual. Included
          you come step by step into peace with yourself, your environment and the world.</p>

        <p>We integrate the basic emotions of joy, fear,
          Anger and sadness. We have the opportunity to look at our traumas and our own
        or to find assumed (shadow) parts in us.</p>

        <p>In the Turtle Transformation offers we take various aspects of the "Inside Out"
          transformations on.</p>
