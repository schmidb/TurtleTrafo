        We offer leadership training and coaching that addresses business,
        body, mind and spirit. All of our work focuses on empowering leaders,
        fostering authenticity and guiding them towards efficiency and excellence.</p>

        <p>In all of our transformations - including our own - we follow our "Inside Out" process.
        <ol style = "text-align: left">
          <li> I look inside </li>
          <li> I look outside </li>
          <li> I reflect and change </li>
          <li> I feel and go back to step 1 </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this process, each individual can take responsibility for himself and
          at eye level in the contact or authentic exchange with oneself, one
          family member, work colleague, or other individual. Included
          you come step by step into peace with yourself, your environment and the world.</p>

          <p>We integrate the basic emotions of joy, fear,
            anger and sadness. We have the opportunity to look at our traumas and
            to find our own or assumed (shadow) parts in ourselves.</p>

          <p>In all Turtle Transformation offerings, we address various aspects
            of the "inside-out" transformation. If you are interested in the
            "inside out" process, you can get a first impression and feel
            for our work with our <a href="/schnupperkurs">taster course (in German)</a>.</p>
