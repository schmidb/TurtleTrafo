Whenever Markus and I meet for a coaching session, this time is pure inspiration and gives me noticeable courage to work on myself and for personal growth. In my inner dealings with myself, I can become more loving bit by bit and accept setbacks and mistakes increasingly positively and gratefully. Each coaching is highly individual and follows my current needs and everyday challenges, which Markus always recognizes very empathetically.
