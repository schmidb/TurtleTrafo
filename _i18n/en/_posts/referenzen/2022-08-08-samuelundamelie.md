Miriam and Markus have a special gift for providing orientation and guidance in an empathetic and encouraging way. In dealing with our children, we receive enormously valuable and everyday learning in every coaching session. Above all, we are grateful that you two have helped us with your clarity and sensitive manner to organize our mountain of disordered ideas and dreams for the future of our family life and finally to take action bit by bit. With you, change is a joy and you are a great encouragement to us!
