If I am the captain of my life ship, then Miriam was and is the indispensable pilot for me. She has always helped me to steer past many shallows on my way through dangerous waters. When I got disoriented, she showed me ways to get back on the right course and stay on it. She never took the helm, but rather showed me how I can steer my ship myself. Thanks!
