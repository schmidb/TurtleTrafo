## What we Do
Empathy is a big new buzzword in leadership. It is the link between managers and employees. Unfortunately, true empathy only comes from connecting with and empathizing with yourself.
This 6 week empathy kickstart includes 3 weeks of personal development and personal immersion in your values, emotions and behaviours as well as tools to deal with yourself. The other 3 weeks we focus on tools and methods to lead through empathy.

* We start with a 3 hour kickstart workshop.
* Afterwards, you join our online community and receive inspiration to bring empathetic leadership into your daily business.
* You build a buddy team with one other participant to support you in your daily change process.
* Every week, we release an audio message with new directions to increase your empathic leadership skills.
* For every week between the workshops, you align a personal 30 minutes coaching session with Miriam or Markus. (overall 4 coaching sessions)
* We finish your transformation with another 3 hour workshop.


#### Agenda:
##### Day 1 - beginning of course:
* What is empathy and self-empathy?<br>
*Basically the same, except that you are as empathetic to others as you are to yourself. Empathy is the ability to deal constructively with emotions in general. This ability allows you to see, fall in love, and connect with others in a caring and calm way.*
* Your emotions and your mind<br>
*Most of our emotions are not consciously perceived. Instead, we have thought and reaction patterns. To change this, we need to quiet the mind and connect on an emotional level.*
* Mindful working and living

##### Inspirations:
* Making connections and empathic leadership<br>
*Every communication contains your own reality and the reality of your counterpart. To create an empathic exchange, you need to see, understand and connect the different realities.*
* Active listening and authentic communication<br>
*We will use all your new skills to make connections, manage your emotions, and listen to other people with an open and empathetic mind. It will create a new experience in communicating with your employees.*
* Observation and empathy in meetings
*Having many people in a room brings many different emotions and energies into action. As an empathetic leader, you are able to identify most of them and lead your meeting to efficient outcomes.*

##### Personal coaching: 
* customized training and toolkit for your specific leadership situation

##### Day 2 - end of course
* Projecting stories onto others<br>
*When you start actively listening to your thoughts, you will see many assumptions. We don't know if they're true or not, and this opens the door for our subconscious to project stories onto other people. As we begin to unravel these stories, we will find hidden truths about ourselves, and often a very different story behind the other person.*
* Empathy in your daily life
