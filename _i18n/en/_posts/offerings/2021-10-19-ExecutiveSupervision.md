Leaders have a complex task that includes making many decisions every day. In addition to professional skills there are expectations for communication skills, sovereignty, integrity, decision-making power, effectiveness, sense of responsibility, orientation, assertiveness, ability to cooperate, empathy, authenticity, flexibility, an "eye for the essential" and much more. So it is a lot about your individual personality. The conscious design of the leadership role and the ability to self-reflect - with the aim of examining one's own individual perception, thinking and feeling, and the personal communication behavior - are important for your successful leadership.

Colleagues, team members, internal coaches and HR business partners are good sparring partners. However, these are usually tied to the same processes, the same business idea, the same strategy or vision. Supervision coaching with an external coach gives you the opportunity to focus and achieve high-quality execution of all tasks without feeling overwhelmed.
