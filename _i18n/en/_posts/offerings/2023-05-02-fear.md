# The way to a peaceful relationship with your fear

### 1. Awareness
Refine your senses on your triggers.

### 2. Calm your body and mind
Anxiety triggers your stress responses that stop maintaining them in your body and suppress the immune system. Practice practical techniques to stop the stress response to get your body back to normal and your mind clear and grounded.

### 3. Find the root cause of your trigger and work it off
Become aware of your fear-induced stories and let go of those that no longer fit.

### 4. Build courage
Confidence and courage-based thinking gives you a head start in anxiety-provoking situations.
