## Prerequisites - commitment to do the work:
<i>
The members of the 66 Days of Change Team are PEACEFUL WARRIORS.
They seek peace within themselves and with the world and repeatedly choose peace-making words and deeds for their path.
They have a clear vision and are flexible in the course of their journey.
For this time(and beyond), that person is you.
</i>

<i>
As part of the 66 Days of Change Team,
I stand for seeing my life as my responsibility.
</i>

<i>
I stand for taking good care of myself.
That means I take the time to take care of myself, to communicate with myself in a loving and accepting way, to perceive my needs and to respond to them.
</i>

<i>
I train every day.
I'm radically honest with myself.
I am truly seeing.
I feel all my feelings and get to know them with an open and curious mind.
I respect my body.
That means I pay attention to how it is doing, I give it nutritious food that suits it, I give it enough sleep, exercise and rest.
</i>

<i>
I develop myself by getting to know myself honestly:
I ask myself who I am, what inspires me, what is important to me and what I need to be at peace with myself and the world.
