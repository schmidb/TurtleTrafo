            <p> The turtle is a timeless creature that lives on land and in the sea
                lives. Slowness and old age make the turtle one
                primeval animal that exudes trust and peace. As a power animal
                turtle, the animal stands for grounding, patience and (primordial) trust. <p>

              <p> We find many in the characteristics and abilities of the turtle
                approaches that accompany us on the way of Turtle Transformations:
                <h4> Lives in the tank </h4>
                The turtle lives in a tank and uses it to protect itself from enemies
                to protect and withdraw in case of stress. Draw in our "from the inside from the outside" process
                we also go back to our inside and feel, then look what is outside and
                only then do we reflect and change.
                <h4> Back to the origin </h4>
                Most species of turtles lay their eggs where they will
                hatched themselves. In our "inside out" process, we also return
                always back to step 1 and start again or iteratively
                to change.
                <h4> Excellent senses and feelings </h4>
                Turtles have excellent orientation, smell, and sight
                feeling. We humans also have a highly developed sensory perception.
                This allows sensory impressions (including feelings and emotions), often finer than us
                is aware, perceive.
                <h4> Slowness </h4>
                Most turtles move very slowly. Mostly they just lay
                go back 20 to 50 centimeters in an hour. Change is also a slow process
                and need a lot of patience.
                <h4> For thousands of years </h4>
                Turtles have been shown to have existed on earth for over 200 million years.
                Constant change is also an essential part of our earth and
                human development. Awareness that change is a natural part
                of life facilitates any transformative process.
