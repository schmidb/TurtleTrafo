    text: "Together we find ways to help people live the life they love by
    working efficiently and being respectful of themselves and others.
    They move organically in teams and together they achieve even bigger dreams.
   <br><br>
    It all starts within yourself. When you have clarity about what is
    going on inside you, you enable yourself to see the hidden dependencies
    that the unconscious brings into all interactions between us humans.
    With this clarity we can create together and achieve every corporate goal."

    text: "Everything starts within ourselves. We trust ourselves and follow
    our heart-mind. We are all able to take responsibility for ourselves and
    engage in contact or authentic exchange with ourselves, a family member
    or other people. Coming step by step we are at peace with ourselves, our
    environment and the world.
     <br><br>
    When we rest within ourselves and have our own clarity, then we can
    fulfill any dream, find relaxation in any situation and create new life models."
